# Search Agent
This example demonstrates how to build a simple search agent that uses the [Sentient Agent Framework](https://github.com/sentient-agi/Sentient-Agent-Framework). **The most important part of the example is the `resume_agent.py` file, which demonstrates how to subclass the `AbstractAgent` class, implement the `assist` method, and create and serve Sentient Chat events.**

## Running the search agent
> [!NOTE]
> **These instructions are for unix-based systems (i.e. MacOS, Linux). Before you proceed, make sure that you have installed `python` and `pip`. If you have not, follow [these](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/) instructions to do so.**

#### 1. Create secrets file
Create the `.env` file by copying the contents of `.env.example`. This is where you will store all of your agent's credentials.
```
cp .env.example .env
```

#### 2. Add model credentials
Add your Fireworks API key to the `.env` file (you can also use any other OpenAI compatible inference provider).

#### 3. Add search provider credentials
Add your Tavily API key to the `.env` file.

#### 4. Create Python virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

#### 5. Activate Python virtual environment:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### 6. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 7. Run the search agent:
```
python3 -m src.resume_agent.resume_agent
```

#### 8. Use a tool like [CuRL](https://curl.se/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to query the server. The agent exposes a single `assist` endpoint:
```
curl -N --location 'http://0.0.0.0:8000/assist' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "query": {
        "id": "01JQETZTSNT4KC0TRS6EBN32TG",
        "prompt": "Who is Lionel Messi?"
    },
    "session" : {
        "processor_id": "Example processor ID",
        "activity_id": "01JR8SXE9B92YDKKNMYHYFZY1T",
        "request_id": "01JR8SY5PHB9X2FET1QRXGZW76",
        "interactions": []
    }
}'
```
Expected output:
```
