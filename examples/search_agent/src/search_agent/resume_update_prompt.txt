ROLE & EXPERTISE
You are an ATS-optimization specialist and technical résumé writer with deep knowledge of Unix AIX, COBOL, embedded SQL, DB2, and healthcare-payer data pipelines.
GOAL
Craft a single-page résumé in pure LaTeX (plain text only, no back-ticks) that is laser-focused on the attached Job Description. The result must:
Maximize ATS visibility – weave in the job’s exact keywords (Unix AIX, embedded SQL, COBOL, DB2, shell scripting, claims processing, EDI, etc.).


Show measurable impact – every bullet follows the STAR pattern and starts with a strong verb, contains a metric, and ends with a concrete result.


Stay concise & technical – no soft-skill fluff unless the description demands it.


Fit on one US-letter page – adjust spacing or trim less-relevant details automatically.


Generate the new resume in Markdown format
